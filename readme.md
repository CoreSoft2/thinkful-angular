The AngularJS philosophy

http://glennstovall.com/blog/2013/06/27/angularjs-an-overview/

The AngularJS philosophy is based on embracing and extending HTML, while meeting the needs of both new and experienced developers.

Enhanced HTML
HTML works well when used to describe static documents, but it falls short when used to describe the "views" of a rich web application. This is just not something it was ever designed to support. Most JavaScript frameworks address this limitation by either abstracting away the HTML or requiring a large dose of hand-crafted DOM manipulation JavaScript code. AngularJS takes a different approach. Instead of hiding HTML and CSS, it embraces their strengths and extends them to make them suitable for describing dynamic views. The result is a workflow that should feel very familiar to any web developer and a JavaScript programming style that is surprisingly concise, clear, and focused.

Simple yet scalable
Another distinguishing characteristic of AngularJS is that it is very approachable for newcomers yet offers powerful and sophisticated features for developers with more complex needs. Other frameworks either focus on simplicity without providing much assistance in creating complex apps, or offer sophisticated features but require lots of boilerplate code and moving parts for even the simplest apps.
