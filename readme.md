# AngularJS by Example - Building a Bitcoin Investment Calculator

Angular JS is a powerful Javascript framework created by Google to build maintainable web applications. In this tutorial we'll design a basic app that highlights much of what the framework has to offer. 

> First, before going any further, to fully understand this tutorial you need to be comfortable with *vanilla* Javascript, not just jQuery. For a crash course in Javascript, check out the Codeacademy Javascript [track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript). 

The application we'll be developing is a Bitcoin investment calculator that details how much you could *potentially* profit if you invested X amount of dollars in Bitcoins. Through this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of designing a web app using Angular while also highlighting many of the key features of the framework, including templating, data-binding, and routing. 

Here's a sneak peak of what we're building:

## What is Angular?

Originally developed in 2009 by two Google employees, Angular is well suited for creating dynamic, single page applications (SPAs) within the familiar Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm:

*In Angular applications, the view is the Document Object Model (DOM), the controllers are JavaScript classes, and the model data is stored in object properties.

We think MVC is neat for several reasons. First, it gives you a mental model for where to put what, so you don’t have to invent it every time. Other folks collaborating on your project will have an instant leg up on understanding what you’ve written, as they’ll know you’re using MVC structure to organize your code. Perhaps most importantly, we’ll claim that it delivers great benefits in making your app easier to extend, maintain, and test.* 

Working within that paradigm, you will soon find out, how easy it is to add (or bind) data to your page, which automatically updates because the framework is always "watching" for changes. Say goodbye to jQuery.

Angular is also very easy to learn since it works directly with HTML, simply extending its functionality.

## Features

Templates : Templates reside right in the DOM. No more Handlebars! 
Two-way data-binding : Changes in your JS automatically update the DOM - and vice versa.
Routing : Easily associate controllers with temapltes
Directives : Encapsulates templates and code in reusable components easily.
Testability : AngularJS was designed in a way your web app can be fully testable.
Animation : Easily animate elements and views.
