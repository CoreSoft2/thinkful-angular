# AngularJS by Example - Building a Bitcoin Investment Calculator

Angular JS is a powerful Javascript MVC framework created by Google to build maintainable web applications. In this tutorial we'll design a basic app that highlights much of what the framework has to offer. 

> First, before going any further, to fully understand this tutorial you need to be comfortable with *vanilla* Javascript, not just jQuery. For a crash course in Javascript, check out the Codeacademy Javascript [track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript). 

The application we'll be developing is a Bitcoin investment calculator that details how much you could *potentially* profit if you invested X amount of dollars in Bitcoins. Through this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of designing a web app using Angular while also highlighting the key features of the framework. 

Here's a sneak peak of what we're building:

## Philosophy

The AngularJS philosophy

1. Data First: update data, then DOM (not other way around like jQuery) / declarative not imperative / no longer having to maintain the DOM!
2. Extending HTML: embraces HTML, making it easy for new developers to learn the "Angular-way"
3. Simple, yet scaleable: start simple, but you can create very, very complex, scalable apps 
4. Testable: designed for end to end testing, design paradigms force you to break app into tiny testable pieces


## Building Blocks / Terminology

1. MVC - quote from angular book
2. Services
3. Directives

## App Time

### Grabbing Data

From bitcoin API

### Bare Essentials / Page Setup

Barebones app/MVC

### Scope

Relationship between scope and the controller / how to divide the page up with multiple scopes

### Binding

Whenever an input changes so does the variable, instantly.
