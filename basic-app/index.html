  I would have called this bootstrapping, once for the app and once for the controller
  ngApp is sugar for angular.bootstrap
    http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap
  ngController is a directive that will run the btcCtrl controller

  I also think the names should be more generous, short compressed names can
  be intimidating and hard to remember for beginners. Additionally the 
  compressed names are only differentiated by the last three characters. There's 
  nothing wrong with bitcoinCalculator or bitcoinController.

  @expand why do add this? why do we put it on the html element? can we put it
          anywhere on the page?
